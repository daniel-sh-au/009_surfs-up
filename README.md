# Module 9: Surf's Up with Advanced Data Storage and Retrieval

## Overview of the Analysis

### Purpose
Since W. Avy, the investor for our project, requested additional information regarding temperature trends, an analysis was completed to determine if the surf and ice cream shop business would be sustainable year-round. By extracting temperature data from the hawaii.sqlite database for the months of June and December, we can predict the successfulness of the the business. 

### Resources
